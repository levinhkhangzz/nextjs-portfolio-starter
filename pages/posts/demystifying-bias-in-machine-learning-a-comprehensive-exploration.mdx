### 1. \(\int\limits_0^{\frac{\pi }{2}} {\left( \frac{\cos x}{\sqrt{7 + \cos^2 x}} + \frac{1}{\cos x + 2} \right)} dx\)

#### Solution:

We'll solve each term separately:

1. **\(\frac{\cos x}{\sqrt{7 + \cos^2 x}}\):**
   - Let \(u = \cos x\), then \(du = -\sin x \, dx\).
   - The integral becomes \(-\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{7 + u^2}} \, du\).
   - Use \(u = \sqrt{7} \tan \theta\) to simplify the integral.
   - The integral becomes \(-\int \sec \theta \, d\theta\), which is \(-\ln|\sec \theta + \tan \theta| + C\).

2. **\(\frac{1}{\cos x + 2}\):**
   - Let \(v = \cos x + 2\), then \(dv = -\sin x \, dx\).
   - The integral becomes \(-\int \frac{1}{v} \, dv\), which is \(-\ln|v| + C\).

Now integrate both results over the given bounds \([0, \frac{\pi}{2}]\) and add them up.

### 2. \(\int\limits_1^\ell {x\ln^3 x(\ln x + 2)dx}\)

#### Solution:

1. Let \(u = \ln x\), then \(du = \frac{1}{x} \, dx\).
2. Substitute to get \(\int u^3 (u + 2) \, du\).
3. Integrate to get \(\frac{1}{4}u^4 + \frac{1}{2}u^3\).
4. Substitute back and integrate over \([1, \ell]\).

### 3. \(\int\limits_0^{\frac{\pi }{2}} {x^{17} \cos^3 x(9\cos x - 2x\sin x)dx}\)

#### Solution:

This integral involves multiple applications of integration by parts and trigonometric identities. It's a bit involved, and I recommend using a computer algebra system or specialized software to handle the complexity.

### 4. \(\int\limits_0^1 {\left( \frac{1}{x^4 + x^2 + 1} + x^3 (1 - x^2)^3 \right)} dx\)

#### Solution:

1. Break the integral into two parts.
2. For \(\frac{1}{x^4 + x^2 + 1}\), complete the square in the denominator and use trigonometric substitution.
3. For \(x^3 (1 - x^2)^3\), expand and simplify.
4. Integrate each part separately over \([0, 1]\) and add the results.

For the third integral, using computational tools such as Wolfram Alpha or symbolic computing environments like Python with SymPy can provide detailed solutions due to its complexity.
